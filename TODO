Known Bugs, yet to be fixed:
* TikkleMod
    befriending-function is checking nicknames case-sensitively
* KarmaMod
    karma is aware of case :<
    thus chosi has different karma than Chosi. i'm losing lot's of points here!!!1 ;-)

(case-sensitivity is generally a thing worth analyzing here ;))


Todo (i.e. Upcoming Features):
* DecideMod
    Perform a decision-calculation for someone else, i.e.
    !decide -n <nickname> <decidestring>
